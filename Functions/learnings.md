# 📚 Learnings from Functions Calculator App

- Practiced **Function Declaration**:

  - Can be called **before it's defined** in the code.

- Practiced **Function Expression**:

  - Cannot be called before definition — otherwise, you get a **ReferenceError**.

- Built a **calculator** using two functions:

  - Function Declaration → for main calculation.
  - Function Expression → optional, for comparison.

- Understood **difference in hoisting** between function declarations and expressions.

- Linked **functions with DOM events** to make the calculator interactive.
