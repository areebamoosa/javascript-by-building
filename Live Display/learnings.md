# 📚 Learnings from DOM Manipulation Mini-Project

- **Live Display**:

  - Used `input` event to detect every change in the text field as the user types.
  - Updated another element (`div#display`) in real-time with `innerText`.

- **DOM Concepts Practiced**:
  - `getElementById` to grab elements from the DOM.
  - `addEventListener` to attach events.
  - `innerText` to dynamically change content on the page.
  - Real-time interactivity without refreshing the page.

### Side Note:

#### input (event):

It’s a type of event in JavaScript, which fires every time the value of an `<input>` changes — whether by typing, deleting, etc.
