# 🚀 JavaScript by Building — 35+ Mini JS Projects

A curated collection of **35+ JavaScript mini projects**, built entirely from my own ideas and structured learning plan — starting from core basics and progressing to advanced JavaScript concepts.

This repository represents my journey of **deeply understanding JavaScript logic**, not by copying code, but by **building, experimenting, breaking, and fixing things myself**.

📌 Every project was built to understand _why_ something works, not just _how_
