# 📚 Learnings from Tab System Project

- Practiced **DOM selection** using `querySelectorAll` to grab multiple elements (`tabs` and `tab-content`).

- Learned to **loop through elements** using `forEach` to add click event listeners.

- Used **`classList.add` and `classList.remove`** to toggle the `.active` class for showing/hiding content.

- Learned how to **read custom attributes** with `getAttribute("data-tab")` to match tabs with their content.

- Learned the importance of **removing active states from all elements** before activating the selected tab to maintain a clean UI.
