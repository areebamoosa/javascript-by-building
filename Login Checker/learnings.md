# Learnings from this Login Checker Project

## Project Overview

This mini-project was designed to create a simple login checker using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The primary goal was to practice and understand **logical operators** (`===`, `!==`, `&&`, `||`) in a real-world scenario.

## Key Learnings

### 1. **Understanding Logical Operators**

- Used `&&` to ensure **both email and password** were correct for a successful login.
- Used `||` to handle cases where **either email or password** might be incorrect.
- Practiced conditional branching (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to respond to different combinations of inputs.

### 2. **Input Validation**

- Understood the importance of validating both the email and password fields.
- Handled different scenarios such as:
  - Both email and password correct
  - Only email correct
  - Only password correct
  - Both incorrect

### 3. **User Interaction**

- Displayed alerts to give feedback to users when credentials were incorrect.
- Added a "Try Again" button that resets input fields using `.value = ""`.

This project was a great hands-on experience to solidify basic JavaScript skills, especially around logic building and DOM interaction.
