# 📚 What I Learned from This Project – Data Type Checker

## Main Goal
Built a small **JavaScript Data Type Checker** to understand and practically use the `typeof` operator, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

---

##  Key Learnings

### 1. **`typeof` in Action**
- Learned how `typeof` helps in detecting the data type of a given value.
- Practiced differentiating between **string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint**.

### 2. **DOM Selection & Manipulation**
- Used `getElementById()` and `querySelector()` to grab HTML elements.
- Created new elements dynamically with `createElement()` and added them using `appendChild()`.

### 3. **Event Handling**
- Learned to respond to button clicks with `addEventListener("click", callback)`.

### 4. **Conditional Logic with `switch`**
- Used `switch` statements for cleaner and more organized code instead of multiple `if-else`.

### 5. **Error Handling**
- Wrapped logic inside `try...catch` to prevent the app from crashing on invalid inputs.

### 6. **UI State Control**
- Used `.classList.toggle()` to hide/show elements dynamically.
- Implemented a **Clear** button to reset the input and output.

## 🚀 Extra Takeaways
- Learned the difference between **empty value (`null`)** and **no value assigned (`undefined`)**.
- Got familiar with **bigint** and **symbol**, which are less commonly used but important.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts
This project was a simple yet powerful way to:
- Practice JavaScript basics.

- Understand **data types** not just in theory, but by actually seeing them in action.
