# 📚 Learnings from History Object Mini-Project

- Explored the **browser’s history stack**: stores pages visited in the current session.

- Learned to **navigate pages programmatically** :
  - `history.back()` → go to the previous page.
  - `history.forward()` → go to the next page.
- Learned to **check history length** :
  - `history.length` → number of pages in the current session.
- Built a simple **2-page navigator** with Back and Forward buttons.
